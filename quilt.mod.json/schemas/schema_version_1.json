Generally this means classes which are functional interfaces.\n\t* Constructor requirement varies based on the method being static or instance level:\n\t\t* A static method does not require a public no-argument constructor.\n\t\t* An instance method requires a public no-argument constructor.\n\t* Example: `example.mod.MainModClass::init`\n\t* If there is ambiguity with a fields's name or other method, an exception will be thrown.\n\n#### Other notations\n\nSome language providers may extend the capabilities of the JVM language notation or provide additional notations.\nFor notation rules for other language adapters, consult the capabilities of the language adapter.",
